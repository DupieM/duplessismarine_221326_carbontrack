### Project Description

This term we were tasked to create and conceptualise any type of application for any problem we are facing from a list of options like (Enviromental, social, etc.) and to utilise some of the various AI technologies we went through in class. This application will consist of front-end and back-end requirements, as to create a real-world application that can aid or have a positive impact on researched field.The mobile application I am creating will be used to calculate a users carbon Footprint, show them their data on two charts, give insights on theri data that is calculated and will also give reducing tips for general and for their specific carbon footprint data.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
<!-- Make sure to add appropriate information about what prerequesite technologies the user would need and also the steps to install your project on their own mashines -->
## Getting Started

The following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the latest version of [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-project/) installed on your machine. The Expo app for a mobile phone will also be required.

### How to install

### Installation

1. Go to Github Desktop and then click on clone new repository

2. Enter `https://github.com/DupieM/duplessismarine_221326_carbontrack.git` into the URL field and press the `Clone` button.

To start the Expo app and install dependancies on laptop:

1.  Go to Visual Studio code  </br>
   Open your Visual Studio code then click on File and then click on Open folder.
    Then navigate to where you have cloned the repository and open it.

2.  Start terminal </br>
   Go to 'Terminal' then click on new terminal.
